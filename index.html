            <h5>Why Good Reads?</h5>
            <p>
                Good Reads search layout is based on early 2010s design guidelines.
                It does not utilize a container fluid layout to maximize space usage.
                The search results are not highlighted as well as they could be.
            </p>
            <h5>UI/UX Problems</h5>
            <p>
                Search results do not have filters, making it hard to find relevant results.
                The search results are also packed into a small grid layout. This makes it hard to
                visually separate products, and hence, making it harder to quickly browse through it.
                The filters are non-existent, but there is a limited Genre selector on the right.
                The user is not able to quickly narrow down what their looking for.
            </p>
            <h5>Accessibility Summary</h5>
            <p>
                The website has a lot of empty buttons, this would make it difficult for a screen reader to
                navigate the website. Similarly, there are a few images and forms missing alternate text.
                One major issue pointed out by WebAIM is low contrast, which indicates that the background blurs into
                the foreground. The issues pointed out by WebAim are important and should be addressed in order to
                make the website accessible for everyone.
